This repository documents my learning journey through foundational quantum computing algorithms, simulations, and circuit implementations using **Qiskit**, as part of the **Summer of Code 2025**. Over the past few weeks, I’ve explored key quantum computing concepts by writing and simulating quantum circuits, building both theoretical understanding and practical skills in quantum programming.

## 🌱 What I’ve Learned

### 🧠 1. **Qubit Superposition**

* **Files**: `superposition_1q.py`, `superposition_2q.py`
* I began with single- and two-qubit circuits applying Hadamard gates to create **quantum superpositions**.
* Observed how qubits, unlike classical bits, can exist in a **combination of 0 and 1**, resulting in probabilistic outcomes.
* Learned about **measurement collapsing** the state, and how results reflect the underlying quantum state vector.

### 🔍 2. **Grover’s Search Algorithm**

* **File**: `grover_algo.py`
* Built a two-qubit version of **Grover’s Algorithm** to find a marked item using fewer steps than classical search.
* Designed a simple **oracle** and implemented **inversion about the mean**, which amplifies the target state’s probability.
* Gained a practical understanding of **amplitude amplification** and its advantage in unstructured search problems.

### 🤖 3. **Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm** (2 Implementations)

* **Files**: `deutsch_jozsa.py`, `deutsch_jozsa_random_oracle.py`
* Learned how quantum algorithms can provide **exponential speedup** over classical ones for specific problems.
* Implemented both:

  * A **static oracle version** using `cz` gate (manually built for a balanced function).
  * A **dynamic oracle generator** that simulates constant/balanced oracles using binary patterns and controlled gates.
* Understood how **entanglement and interference** are leveraged to eliminate multiple possibilities in a single shot.

### ⏳ 4. **Phase Estimation Algorithm**

* **File**: `phase_estimation.py`
* Explored the **quantum phase estimation algorithm**, a key building block in Shor’s algorithm and quantum simulations.
* Learned how to construct **controlled-unitary operations**, apply **inverse QFT**, and interpret measured output as an estimate of a phase (eigenvalue).
* This deepened my understanding of the role of **eigenstates**, **unitary operators**, and their phase relationships in quantum systems.

### 🎵 5. **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**

* **File**: `quantum_fourier.py`
* Manually implemented the **QFT** on a 3-qubit register, including Hadamard, controlled-phase gates, and qubit swaps.
* Understood the mathematical transformation from time domain to frequency domain in the quantum sense.
* QFT is essential for many algorithms like Shor’s factoring and solving systems of linear equations in quantum computing.

### 📡 6. **Quantum Teleportation Protocol**

* **File**: `quantum_teleportation.py`
* Created a complete **quantum teleportation circuit** where an unknown quantum state is transferred from one qubit to another without physically moving the qubit itself.
* Built **entangled Bell pairs**, performed **Bell basis measurement**, and applied **conditional corrections** based on classical bits.
* Reinforced concepts of **entanglement**, **quantum information transfer**, and **hybrid classical-quantum control**.
